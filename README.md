# Hospital_BedSlot_Booking_System

## Introduction
Hospital bed slot booking system is a software-based solution that allows patients or their caregivers to reserve hospital beds in advance. The system helps hospitals and medical facilities manage patient admissions, discharges, and bed assignments more efficiently, reducing wait times and improving patient care. Bed slot booking systems can also provide real-time information about bed availability and occupancy, allowing hospitals to optimize their resources and improve their operational efficiency. These systems can be accessed through web portals or mobile applications, making it easier for patients and their families to book beds from anywhere and at any time.

Admin adds hospital users to update databases, while hospital users add/update bed availability.The website facilitates booking of registered hospital beds. User and hospital data is stored in the database. Discharged patient details are deleted from the database and a report is generated and mailed to the user who booked the bed. Machine learning-based recommendations suggest best hospitals for users.

Recommendation system is used to suggest the best hospitals based on the city of the hospital entered. The model is trained with many data of the hospitals in the country. This would be very useful to the users to sort out the best hospital in their location. Analysis part would be much more beneficial for the users and can book the bed in the hospital to get better treatment. The accuracy of the model is 96%. It gives the most accurate result according to the user. When there
is a random hospital which is not there in the dataset, System gives an error. We can improvise the accuracy to 99% by training on various datasets.
